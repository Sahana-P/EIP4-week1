Convolution - Multiplication of input data(some values) with the kernal data and extracting(adding them together) one value.

Kernel/Filter - It act as a feature extracter which extracts one particular feature.

Epoch - If the network sees all the images it is called one epoch.It is looking at the image again and again.Higher the epoch higher the           efficiency

1 * 1 convolution - It is convolution where the kernel size is 1*1.it is multiplying the whole channel with one value.Reduce the depth.
                    It can be used to combine or seperate th echannels.

3 * 3 Convolution - convolution where the kernal size is 3*3.It is used as a standard one wher we can have other sixe kernals ie,for 5*5                       we can add two 3*3 and for 2*2 we can have zero padding.

Feature map - All particular edges stored in one channel is known as Feature map.

Receptive feilds - 
local receptive feilds - Locally in one particular pixel of a kernal how many pixels is seen in the previous layer

Activation function - It is a mathematical function which introduce non-linearity properties.
